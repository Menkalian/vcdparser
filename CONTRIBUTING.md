# Contribution Guide[^1]

We appreciate all kinds of contributions to this project. This document gives you some information on how to contribute to the project.

## How Can I Contribute?

- We suggest to follow the common workflow based on issues and pull requests. In the issue, you should describe the problem. Based on this discussion, one can create a pull request that should solve the issue.
- A good issue describes what is wrong and why it is wrong. Ideally, one has already a suggestion on how to fix the problem, but the suggestions is not mandatory.
- If you open an issue and want to provide a solution, please leave a comment stating your intention :slight_smile:.
- A good pull request should refer to the issue and thus to the problem that it should solve. Explain what the pull request does and how it addresses the problem/issue. If you still work on a new feature or a fix, you can open a pull request and mark is as draft. Once you consider the work done, please mark it as ready for review and request a reviewer. We will give feedback and eventually merge the pull request.
